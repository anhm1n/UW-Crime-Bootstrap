# UW-Crime-Bootstrap
## What is this?
This project folder features a final group project for UW Course STAT 403. The goal was to perform statistical hypothesis testing and examine p-values with regards to to specific null hypotheses. This repository showcases our final paper, presentation slides, and most of our code.

Our scientific questions:
1. Does the proportions of different crimes in the University District differ from the whole of Seattle?
2. In the University District, does the average number of days between the data a crime occurred and the date that crime was reported differ from the whole of Seattle, particularly in the cases of reape, other sexual offenses, and nonviolent family offenses?

## What did I contribute?
I created a simple Power BI Data Visualization, coded a handful, helped create the slides and reviewed the final paper. I enjoyed the collaborative process of the project because it seems like we all contributed a lot. It was most certainly a project where we implemented aspects of our course material and it could be argued that most of our work was in the form of verbal discussion and exploratory analysis. 

## What did I learn?
This was one of the first analyses where I personally applied Bonferroni corrections and empirical bootstrapping to data. This allowed us to bootstrap the estimate of the variance of the proportion of each crime we were working with. But most importantly, I learned how much time the data exploration and planning takes. We spent an incredible amount of time on these two segments and still missed a few things. Luckily, we had a relatively diverse team, and our collaboration let us deliver in the end.
